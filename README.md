# COVID-19-Detection-Using-Chest-CT-Scan-Images
Developed a system to detect COVID-19 using chest CT scan images with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for classification. To enhance performance, we compared various autoencoder architectures using Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the evaluation metric, gaining insights into their effectiveness in feature extraction and dimensionality reduction.
